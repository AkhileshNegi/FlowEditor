# Contributing

Contributions are highly appreciated!

We accept contributions in the form of:

- bug reports
- pull requests for code changes
- documentation updates

All non-trivial pull requests, especially those with functional changes should first open a ticket to discuss approach and likelyhood of inclusion in the project.

Note that we're working towards 100% unit test coverage, and we expect your contributions to help us toward that goal. Contributions that decrease coverage may not be accepted.

This project is licensed under the AGPL-3.0 and your contributions will be licensed in the same way. Note that contributing does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.
